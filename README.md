# PRODIGY-ML-01
A linear regression model to predict house prices using features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms, built with Python.
# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Linear regression model implementation using scikit-learn.
- Evaluation metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script or notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Applications
- Predict housing prices based on given features.
- A useful tool for real estate analysis and pricing strategies.
